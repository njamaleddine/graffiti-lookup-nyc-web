# Project Prompt: Graffiti Lookup NYC Web

## Overview
This project is a web application for searching, viewing, and filtering graffiti lookup data for New York City. It includes a geocoding backend and a modern frontend built with Astro and Vue.js components.

## Goals
- Allow users to search for graffiti records by address or location
- Display results on a map and as a list
- Filter graffiti records by status
- Provide fast, accurate geocoding for NYC addresses
- Cache geocode results for performance

## Key Features
- **Search Bar**: Users can enter addresses or keywords to find graffiti records
- **List View**: Results are shown in a scrollable, filterable list
- **Map View**: Results are plotted on a map for spatial context
- **Status Filter**: Users can filter graffiti records by status (e.g., open, closed)
- **Geocoding**: Backend service to convert addresses to coordinates, with caching

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Astro, Vue.js
- **Backend**: Python (geocode service)
- **Data**: JSON files for graffiti lookups and geocode cache

## File Structure
- `src/` — Frontend source code (Astro, Vue components)
- `geocode/` — Python geocoding backend
- `public/` — Static data (JSON caches)
- `scripts/` — Utility scripts

## Example User Stories
- As a user, I want to search for graffiti by address so I can see if my building has any records.
- As a user, I want to see graffiti locations on a map to understand spatial patterns.
- As a user, I want to filter graffiti records by status to focus on unresolved cases.

## Notes

## Code Quality & Best Practices
- All JavaScript code must follow modern best practices as defined in [Clean Code JavaScript](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript).
- All Python code must follow modern best practices as defined in [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/).
- All code must be maintainable, readable, and testable, meeting the standards of a principal full stack software engineer with deep mastery of these languages and domains.
- Code should reflect the combined expertise of leading figures in software engineering and language design, including Guido van Rossum, Tom Christie, Łukasz Langa, Raymond Hettinger, David Beazley, Yury Selivanov, Ines Montani, Brendan Eich, John Resig, Kent C. Dodds, Evan You, Addy Osmani, Linus Torvalds, Martin Fowler, Robert C. Martin, Donald Knuth, Jeff Dean, and Ryan Dahl.
